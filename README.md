Stash for bare-bones upgrades for a Tamiya 'robot tiger'. Will link to vid and such when they are up.

# arduino code

Designed for an ATTINY85, which has rudimentary analog/pwm/timer support. It has blinking/breathing eyes, a red 'on LED' (which I tried to get to do more and failed), a button to start the walking (delay 1sec, then slowly ramps up to 100% speed, stops at 10sec), and of course motor driver through a MOSFET.

# 3d files

There's a "shell" (body over the battery and such) and a attiny mount, which is shaped for the piece of breadboard that I ended up with (..which was sized with a hacksaw, so it isn't anything special).
